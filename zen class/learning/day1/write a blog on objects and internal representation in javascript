objects:

objects are fundamental entities that allow developers to store collections of data and more complex entities.
In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs.
The keys are strings (or symbols), and the values can be any data type, including other objects or functions.

Internal Representation:

Internally, objects in JavaScript are implemented as hash tables 
A hash table is a data structure that associates keys with values, where each key is unique.

Properties: Each property (key-value pair) of an object is stored in the hash table. The property names (keys) are converted into strings if they are not already.
